Naming Conventions
1. Elements within a scene
	A. Name only needed elements
	B. Use "x:Name"
	C. Be consistent in your naming.
	D. Use Pascal casing. It is more readable, it involves less typing of unnecessary prefixes, and almost truly represents the behavior, because the generated members are internal.
	E. Provide meaningful names. Instead of a name like border1, use something like TrackBackgroundBorder.
	F. Make the x:Name attribute the first attribute after a type instance, like this:
		<Button x:Name="CancelButton" ... />
	G. Postfix names with the type of the element. For example, use a convention like 
		x:Name="CustomerListBox" or x:Name="SearchTextBox".
2. Elements within a template
	A. Parts that the control expected should be prefixed with "PART_"
	B. As elements with in a scene
