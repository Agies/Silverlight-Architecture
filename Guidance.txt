Guidance
1. Take Performance Tips to Heart (See: Performance Tips)
2. Offer a Compelling Installation Experience
3. Don't Make the User Wait
4. Don’t use unnecessary “xmlns” namespaces in the XAML file.
5. Don’t add same namespaces multiple times in a single XAML page.
6. Use proper name for your “xmlns” namespace prefix (For example: xmlns:commonControls is more meaningful than xmlns:cctrl). 
7. Try avoiding “xmlns” namespace prefix name as “local”. Instead use “localControls” or “localConverters” etc. as per your namespace name.
8. When adding a control that has no elements inside it, better to close it by self-closing tag “/>” instead of the hard closing tag (</TAG>).  
9. Remove all unnecessary resource keys if they are not in use. 
10. Don’t use extra panels (e.g. Grid, StackPanel, Canvas etc.) unless it is required. 
11. Always try to use Grid as your panel first and if you require other panels, use them.
12. Never try to give a name to all of your controls inside your Silverlight page as it takes unnecessary object creation at the time of load. 
14. Use proper formatting of your XAML code.
15. Try to use StaticResource instead of DynamicResource as it increases the performance and also it throws exceptions at development time. Hence, easier to identify the root cause. 
16. Remove unnecessary styles & storyboard animations if they are not require at all. 
17. Try to add your styles in a separate file if you want to share them across your application. If they are specific to a single page then add them in the page resource.
18. Wrap control templates in styles to reduce "hard-coded" behaviors.
19. Be explicit when referencing file-based resources using "pack://" often.
